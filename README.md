# Segment_Anything-with-SAM
The Segment Anything Model (SAM) is a large, general-purpose computer vision model that can be used to perform a variety of tasks including object detection, classification and prominently image segmentation.
It was developed by Meta AI, and it is based on the Swin Transformer architecture.The segmentation mask is generated using a process called distillation. Distillation is a technique that involves training a smaller model to mimic the predictions of a larger model. In the case of SAM, the smaller model is called the target model, and the larger model is called the foundation model.

The foundation model is first trained on a dataset of images that have been manually segmented. The target model is then trained on a dataset of images that have been automatically segmented by the foundation model. The target model is trained to generate segmentation masks that are similar to the segmentation masks generated by the foundation model.

Once the target model is trained, it can be used to generate segmentation masks for new images. The segmentation masks can then be used for a variety of tasks, such as object detection, classification, and image editing.
